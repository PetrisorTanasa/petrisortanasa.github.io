The sending host sets the initial TTL value; which is decreased by one each time the packet is processed by a router. If the TTL field decrements to zero, the router discards the packet and sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Time Exceeded message to the source IP address. The Differentiated Services (DS) field is used to determine the priority of each packet. Sequence Number and Acknowledgment Number are two fields in the TCP header."

        "explanation": "Explanation: Network mode is not an authentication mode, it refers to WLAN standards for 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ad and the ability for access points to operate in mixed mode to support different standards, but it is not an authentication mode. Open authentication is a null authentication mode because wireless connectivity is granted to any wireless device. This authentication is used where security is not a concern. Passive mode is not an authentication mode, it refers to the open advertisement of the SSID, standards, and security settings by an access point. Shared-key authentication uses a pre-shared key between the client and the access point."

        "correctAnswers": [
            "rogue access point"
        ],
        "explanation": "Explanation: Configuring the cell phone to act as a wireless access point means that the cell phone is now a rogue access point. The employee unknowingly breached the security of the company network by allowing a user to access the network without connecting through the company access point. Cracking is the process of obtaining passwords from data stored or transmitted on a network. Denial of service attacks refer to sending large amounts of data to a networked device, such as a server, to prevent legitimate access to the server. Spoofing refers to access gained to a network or data by an attacker appearing to be a legitimate network device or user."

        "correctAnswers": [
            "An IDS would allow malicious traffic to pass before it is addressed, whereas an IPS stops it immediately."
        ],
        "explanation": "Explanation: An IPS is deployed in inline mode and will not allow malicious traffic to enter the internal network without first analyzing it. An advantage of this is that it can stop an attack immediately. An IDS is deployed in promiscuous mode. It copies the traffic patterns and analyzes them offline, thus it cannot stop the attack immediately and it relies on another device to take further actions once it detects an attack. Being deployed in inline mode, an IPS can negatively impact the traffic flow. Both IDS and IPS can use signature-based technology to detect malicious packets. An IPS cannot replace other security devices, such as firewalls, because they perform different tasks."

The threat actor continually sends TCP SYN session request packets with a randomly spoofed source IP address to an intended target. The target device replies with a TCP SYN-ACK packet to the spoofed IP address and waits for a TCP ACK packet. Those responses never arrive. Eventually the target host is overwhelmed with half-open TCP connections and denies TCP services."

            "Implement encryption for sensitive traffic."
        ],
        "explanation": "Explanation: The implementation of an access list may provide extra security by permitting denying a flow of traffic, but it will not provide a direct response to limit the success of the attack. The implementation of a firewall on the network edge may prevent reconnaissance attacks from the Internet, but attacks within the local network are not prevented. By implementing restrictions on the sending of ICMP echo-reply messages within a local network, devices may not respond to ping messages, but port scans are not prevented and clear-text data sent on the network are still vulnerable. The best security measure is to encrypt as much network traffic as possible, both user data and network management traffic."

AES aligns with WPA2 as an encryption standard, and is stronger than TKIP or RC4. PSK refers to pre-shared passwords, an authentication method that can be used by either WPA or WPA2.

            "They can show the location of the original file."
        ],
        "explanation": "Explanation: In Linux, a hard link is another file that points to the same location as the original file. A soft link (also called a symbolic link or a symlink) is a link to another file system name. Hard links are limited to the file system in which they are created and they cannot link to a directory; soft links are not limited to the same file system and they can link to a directory. To see the location of the original file for a symbolic link use the ls –l command."

        "explanation": "Explanation: The TCP SYN Flood attack exploits the TCP three-way handshake. The threat actor continually sends TCP SYN session request packets with a randomly spoofed source IP address to an intended target. The target device replies with a TCP SYN-ACK packet to the spoofed IP address and waits for a TCP ACK packet. Those responses never arrive. Eventually the target host is overwhelmed with half-open TCP connections and denies TCP services."

A zone defines a boundary where traffic is subjected to policy restrictions as it crosses to another region of the network. The policy between zones can be established to restrict multiple protocol sessions such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP. One design consideration is to identify subsets within zones and merge traffic requirements because multiple zones might be indirectly attached to a single interface of a firewall."

Zones establish the security borders of a network.\nStep 2. Establish policies between zones – For each pair of “source-destination” zones, define the sessions that clients in the source zones can request from servers in destination zones.\nStep 3. Design the physical infrastructure – After the zones have been identified, and the traffic requirements between them documented, the administrator must design the physical infrastructure. This includes dictating the number of devices between most-secure and least-secure zones and determining redundant devices.\nStep 4. Identify subsets within zones and merge traffic requirements – For each firewall device in the design, the administrator must identify zone subsets that are connected to its interfaces and merge the traffic requirements for those zones."

Zones establish the security borders of a network.\nStep 2 . Establish policies between zones – For each pair of “source-destination” zones, define the sessions that clients in the source zones can request from servers in destination zones.\nStep 3 . Design the physical infrastructure – After the zones have been identified, and the traffic requirements between them documented, the administrator must design the physical infrastructure. This includes dictating the number of devices between most-secure and least-secure zones and determining redundant devices.\nStep 4 . Identify subsets within zones and merge traffic requirements – For each firewall device in the design, the administrator must identify zone subsets that are connected to its interfaces and merge the traffic requirements for those zones."

This provides scalability because one policy affects any given traffic, instead of needing multiple ACLs and inspection actions for different types of traffic.\n– Virtual and physical interfaces can be grouped into zones.\n– Policies are applied to unidirectional traffic between zones.\nBoth IOS Classic Firewalls and ZPFs can be enabled concurrently on a Cisco router.

    ],
    "explanation": "In a brute-force attack, an attacker tries every possible key with the decryption algorithm knowing that eventually one of them will work. To defend against the brute-force attacks, modern cryptographers have as an objective to have a keyspace (a set of all possible keys) large enough so that it takes too much money and too much time to accomplish a brute-force attack. A security policy requiring passwords to be changed in a predefined interval further defend against the brute-force attacks. The idea is that passwords will have been changed before an attacker exhausts the keyspace.",

    "explanation": "Extended ACLs should be placed as close as possible to the source IP address, so that traffic that needs to be filtered does not cross the network and use network resources. Because standard ACLs do not specify a destination address, they should be placed as close to the destination as possible. Placing a standard ACL close to the source may have the effect of filtering all traffic, and limiting services to other hosts.
